Got it — here’s the **same architecture** but extended **in place** so the *feedback on failed quizzes* becomes a **core feature** rather than an afterthought.

---

## **1. Learning Engine (Adaptive Difficulty + Active Recall)**

This is the brain of the app — how it decides which question to show next.

* **Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SRS)**

  * Use something like **SM-2** (used in Anki) or a lightweight **Leitner system** to space out reviews.
  * Track per-question performance and adjust intervals.
  * Ensure early questions are simple and gradually increase difficulty.
  * Blend in “review” and “challenge” questions in each session.

* **Difficulty Progression Model**

  * Assign each question a difficulty score (could be pre-labeled or based on user accuracy stats).
  * Maintain a rolling difficulty window — e.g., 70% current comfort zone, 30% stretch zone.
  * As accuracy rises above a threshold (e.g., 85% in the current window), shift difficulty upward.

* **Active Recall Implementation**

  * Force retrieval before showing hints or answers.
  * Consider **free recall** (typed response) for higher challenge vs **recognition** (multiple choice) for warm-up.
  * Immediate feedback after answer.

* **Failure Feedback & Reasoning Trainer**

  * When a user fails a quiz:

    * Show **step-by-step reasoning** explaining how to solve the question.
    * Highlight **common misconceptions** for that question type.
    * Provide **one similar practice question** immediately after for reinforcement.
  * Store failure reasons (e.g., “wrong formula”, “misread question”) in the user model for targeted practice later.
  * Optional: “Explain Like I’m 5” mode for simpler, friendlier explanations.

## **2. Engagement Layer (Habit-Forming Elements)**

This is the dopamine engine — keeps users coming back.

* **Reminders & Notifications**

  * Daily “study streak” reminders.
  * Push notifications tied to SRS schedule (“2 questions are ready for review”).
  * Behavioral nudges when a streak is about to break.
  * Targeted reminders for weak topics (“Hey, your algebra skills need a boost — ready for 3 quick questions?”).

* **Gamification**

  * **Leaderboards** (global and friends-only).
  * **XP points** per question answered (extra XP for streaks, fewer for retries).
  * **Streak tracking** (daily/weekly).
  * **Badges** for milestones (e.g., “100 questions mastered”, “10 perfect quizzes in a row”).

* **Progress Visualization**

  * Show progress toward mastery of topics.
  * Highlight recently unlocked “hard” questions.
  * Weak topic heatmap to encourage improvement.

## **3. Personalization Layer**

* Maintain a **user model** storing:

  * Mastery level per topic.
  * Historical performance.
  * Preferred difficulty.
  * Common error patterns (for tailoring feedback).
* Dynamically select questions to keep the user in a **flow state** (not too easy, not too hard).
* Generate **personalized feedback quizzes** focusing on missed concepts.

---

## **5. Analytics & Insights**

**Purpose:** Drive continuous optimization.

**Requirements:**

* Track:

  * Time to answer
  * Confidence rating (optional user input)
  * Reasoning error patterns
* Use aggregated analytics to:

  * Improve difficulty scoring
  * Identify low-quality questions needing rework

---

## **4. Data & Feedback Loop**

* Store performance data in a **question history table**:
  `(user_id, question_id, attempts, successes, last_attempt_date, difficulty_level, fail_reason)`
* Log each quiz attempt in a **quiz\_session table** with time taken, hints used, and retry patterns.
* Use analytics to:

  * Adjust difficulty bands and fine-tune the SRS.
  * Identify topics where feedback explanations need improvement.
  * Spot users who are at risk of dropping out (low activity + high failure rate) and trigger targeted engagement flows.

If you implement this, you’ll have an app that:

1. **Starts easy** (low barrier to entry).
2. **Adapts difficulty** to maintain engagement.
3. **Hooks users with gamification and reminders**.
4. **Uses active recall and spaced repetition** to make learning stick.
5. **Turns failures into learning opportunities** with tailored, actionable feedback.
